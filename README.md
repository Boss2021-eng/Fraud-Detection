# 💳 Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression and XGBoost

This project tackles the problem of **fraud detection** by building and comparing two machine learning models: a baseline **Logistic Regression** model and a powerful **XGBoost** model. The goal is to significantly improve **accuracy** and detection capability using advanced machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview

Fraudulent transactions are a growing threat in the financial sector. This project addresses that challenge by using:

- **Logistic Regression** – A simple, interpretable baseline model.
- **XGBoost** – A high-performance gradient boosting model that drastically improves detection accuracy.

By comparing these two approaches, we demonstrate the impact of advanced modeling on fraud detection effectiveness.
